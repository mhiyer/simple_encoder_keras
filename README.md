# simple_encoder_keras
A simple encoder neural network- created using Keras- to convert an 8 bit representation to 3 bit.
A Jupyter Notebook is uploaded which contains stepwise instructions for obtaining the desired output, along with a heatmap of weights.<br>
An autoencoder ipynb notebook is also included, which combines the encoder-decoder step using an interesting network- the input is mapped to itself.
